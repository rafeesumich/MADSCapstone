UMSI Capstone project for Estimating a car value from pictures and partial data
### Project Introduction: 
A vehicle value depends on a verity of factors. In this project We will study the attributes that are influencing the vehicle value using a combination of ML techniques and predict the fair value of the vehicle from the full or partial details provided by the users.
### Project objective: 
The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning to create a system that can estimate the value of a car. Our aim is to essentially have a simple interface where users can input data about a vehicle (image of the car, make, model, year, etc.) and the model will estimate the price range of what the vehicle is worth. However, one of the functionalities we want our system to have is to be able to still function with partial data. Meaning if the user only provides a picture of the vehicle and the number of miles it has, we want the model to still be able to give a price range, even if it may be a larger range than the model would produce with complete data. As a peripheral focus of project we want to see if factors outside of the direct attributes of a vehicle have a relationship with price, such as location, safety rating and reviews of the vehicle.
